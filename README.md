# Brain-Tumor-Classification

This project focuses on building an efficient and accurate multi-classification model for brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging a diverse dataset of brain MRI images, the model classifies tumors into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. The CNN architecture is optimized with techniques like data augmentation, early stopping, and learning rate reduction, achieving a high test accuracy of 99.14%. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and activation maps help interpret the model's performance, contributing to advancements in medical image analysis and clinical diagnostics.
